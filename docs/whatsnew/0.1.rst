The Base Class
==============

|BoundClass| extends the concept of a bound methods so that a class can be
``bound`` to the instance of another class. Remember that |BoundClass| is a
baseclass, so the specific implementation is determined by which subclass is
used. As a quick example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from bound_class.core.base import BoundClass
    >>> class Example2:
    ...     @property
    ...     def attribute(self):
    ...         bcb = BoundClass()
    ...         bcb.__self__ = self
    ...         return bcb
    >>> ex2 = Example2()
    >>> ex2.attribute
    <bound_class.core.base.BoundClass object at ...>
    >>> ex2.attribute.__self__ is ex2
    True
